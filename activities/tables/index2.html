          <h3>Why don't we use the border property?</h3>
          <p>
            We do not use border property in HTML anymore in our tables because
            the HTML no longer validate it anymore or it's an old stuff back in
            2010's, and some new website now days may no longer use it anymore,
            also our css will not able to overiding it, so we do not use border
            property in our HTML anymore. But we can put it in the CSS by seelct
            each th, tr, td.

          <h3>
            What is the easiest way to color every other row a different color?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We can use the pseudoclass which is "nth-child" to choose the child,
            or specifically choose which even or odd to select, or which child,
            num 1 or 2 or so on. We already use pseudoclass before like the
            ":hover" before in the nav.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h3>When should we use a table?</h3>
          <p>
            When we have a project that contains some statistic data like
            schedule class or anything that needs row columns to make it
            readable in table we can use table to show that data can be more
            readable and more fit in that content.

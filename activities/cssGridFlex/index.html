          <h2>
            How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after
            class?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I think we should spend as much as we need to understand the concept
            basic of grid display, at least get along with the video lecture in
            canvas, then try to understand the basic concept of this, it depends
            on each person how long they will understand. But for today after
            class, at least 30-60 min is fine to only get the basic concept is.

          <h2>What should you focus on during class and after class?</h2>
          <p>
            One thing that I think we should focus during class and after is how
            we get understand to applicate the grid system in our next project.

          <h2>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h2>
          <p>
            One thing that I got about the differences grid and flex from class
            today is, that grid can help us to arange flexibility for both row
            and column, <br />
            in other hand flex only help with one, either row or column
            (horizontal or vertical)
          </p>

      <h1>Note At Class</h1>
      <p>1. Important to know the children and parent</p>
      <p>
        2. fr in Grid, it depends on your number, if you got 1fr 1fr it's gonna
        be 2 and each one got 1, <br />but if you have 1fr 5fr 1fr it's gonna be
        7, and first one got 1 unit, second one got 5 units, third got 1 unit
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Study CSS Grid, one thing you can do by Gird Garden website game (So
        Fun!)

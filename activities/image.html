          <p>
            PNG is unique format, because you can make it transparant for the
            background, and ussually you need use this format when you made your
            own art image like logo or symbol like that.

            How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We can use the CSS, select the ID of the picture then resize it use
            width and height, resize the size.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of
            resizing it using CSS?
          </h3>
          <p>
            It's better to resize the photos using photo editing software before
            we put it in our html file because when we only resize it with CSS
            it will affect when the user open the link of your website sometimes
            it will load too long because the size is to big and you just resize
            with the CSS, but the normal size is still big, so resize the size
            first using editor so it's gonna be smaller and will do not affect
            to your web load.

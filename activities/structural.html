        <h3>Structural Tags</h3>
        <p><strong>(HEADER, NAV, MAIN, FOOTER).</strong></p>

      <li>
        <h3>What goes in the header?</h3>
        <p>
          Searchbar, and all of things in the top of website, sometimes it can
          contains our nav also but <strong>just if you want</strong> to put it
          inside
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What goes in the Nav?</h3>
        <p>
          The navigation, the links that will help the user to move from link to
          link (in BYUH website, the navigations are <strong>About</strong>,
          <strong>Acadstrongics</strong>, <strong>Student Life</strong>,
          <strong>Admissions and aid</strong>)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>
          Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does
          the Nav contain links to another website?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Both, nav can go inside header or after header (outside). Nav only
          contain links to our own webpages, not other website in our Nav.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What goes in Main?</h3>
        <p>
          The content. So, that is why it called Main, so it contains the
          content for the webpages, just let's say from the navigation links
          that we have each navigation has different content, so in this section
          (main) it will contain the content for each major nav
        </p>

      <li>
        <h3>What goes in the Footer?</h3>

        <h3>HTML Validation</h3>
        <p>
          A validated website is easier to read by browsers such as Chrome,
          Mozilla, so make sure our HTML is validated, go to validator.w3.org
          and paste our HTML there and if there is an error it will appear, fix
          it and if it is safe and green your website is good.

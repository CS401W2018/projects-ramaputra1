          <h3>Why is the viewport meta tag important?</h3>
          <p>
            The viewport is a meta tag that we can found in the head, inside of
            the meta tag it shows that it doing with the content and some
            initial scale. <br />
            Meta tag viewport is important, because it helps our website to be
            responsive, it will adjusting the website to different other devices
            like phone, tablet, desktop.

          <h3>How can you adjust the CSS for printing?</h3>
          <p>
            For printing purpose, we will adjust in our CSS with creating 1 more
            file printing.css and copy paste your main.css there, and adjust
            what you want to do with that, let say you want to remove the nav or
            something else. <br />
            After that, link your printing.css in your html and add "media =
            "print"" that indicates it as file css only for printing.
          </p>
        </li>

          <h3>When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?</h3>
          <p>
            Mostly, we dont really worry about this, but for some cases we want
            to work with this. Some cases that asked us to use css for printing
            is for ticketing website that asked the user to print that ticket or
            article website that sometimes the user want to print the website as
            long as it's an article that they can read in offline paper.

          <h2>What you learned about Flex and CSS.</h2>
          <p>
            I learned that flex really flexible, it helped us to positioning our
            content, for example if we want to make our nav bar in center we no
            need to use margin auto anymore, but just use display flex and set
            the justify content and align items. <br />
            Flex really help to modify either column or row direction.

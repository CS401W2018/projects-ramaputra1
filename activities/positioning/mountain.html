          <h3>
            What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give
            examples of each one.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The differences is that block will have a full of the screen as
            widht so it will make a new line, <br />
            and inline will only take as big as content for the width so it will
            required a new line. <br />
            Example: <br />
            Inline: span, a, img. <br />
            Block: p, h1, h3
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What is normal flow in HTML?</h3>
          <p>
            Normal flow is the default flow in HTML CSS, it allows each block
            element to have new line in ordered. So, each block tag wants to
            take the entire width of the screen. Then, if we have a tag inside
            of a block tag it will also take up the width of the previous block
            tag (parents). Then, next block tag will take new line. That is
            normal flow.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h3>
          <p>
            Float allowed us to make the img that we have or element block that
            we have to be on the right or left side, then if we have text there
            we can make our text to be in the next of our image, not in the
            below of the picture. <br />
            We want to clear the float so it will not be collaps, because the
            flow being crash, so we need to make empty div and use that div with
            clear property in CSS, to be clear right, left or both.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h3>
          <p>
            All these property work to positioning the content that we have. It
            works like move that content to another dimension and then it will
            allow us to move the content everywhere that we want using top,
            bottom, left, right with measurement there. <br />
            The difference is: <br />
            absolute: move to another dimension but the place or space before is
            not reserved. <br />
            relative: opposite of the absolute, the space before reserved.
            <br />
            fixed: same but it will fixed there, not move anywhere.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h3>
          <p>
            First, if we use ul just list-style-type = none, then make it block
            so we can give padding to have space there, and style it with border
            and bg color, then use hover as pseudoclass to transform your nav to
            be different when it on hover. if you want to make it horizontally
            use in your ul float, but dont forget to clear it.
          </p>

            Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Go to canvas and find "More CSS and Box Model", and go to "Lecture
            Notes - CSS and Box Model". There are 2 videos for this week.

      <h1>*Note</h1>
      <p>
        1. Normal flow: <strong>(NORMAL)</strong> each block tag wants to take
        the entire width of the screen. Then, if we have a tag inside of a block
        tag it will also take up the width of the previous block tag (parents).
        Then, next block tag will take new line.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. When we use the float it will make the flow collaps, so we use clear
        to make the flow to be normal. nicey!

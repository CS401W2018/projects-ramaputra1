            <h3>
              1. What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Block tag will take full widht as long as the screen and also will
              make a new line, in other hand inline will only as big as the
              content and will not make new line.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>2. What is the margin, border, and padding?</h3>
            <p>
              It's a gap for the content that you have. Padding is the most
              inside for the gap of your content, then, it goes to border, then
              the most outside is margin.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>3. What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h3>
            <p>
              We can use the fix one like px, cm like that, or the relatives one
              like percent, rem, em, vh.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <h3>4. When would you use a figure tag?</h3>
            <p>
              We use that when we have img tag, and we want that img to be wrap
              and change to block, so we have new line for the text that we want
              to input.
            </p>
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>
          1. Margin will <strong>overlapping</strong>, let say if your header
          have <strong>margin-botom 20px</strong>, and right after that you have
          your main tag, you need <strong>more than 20px</strong> for your main
          <strong>margin-top</strong> to move, because you margin is
          overlapping.
        </p>
        <p>2. Text Align, only works for text.</p>
        <p>
          3. Margin Auto: Take up the rest of the space and whatever you have
          available to you. If you put margin-right auto it will move to left
          vice versa. (Try that)
        </p>
        <p>4. Margin Outside, Padding Inside</p>
        <p>
          5. Figure tag, will make your img tag to be block. So it works like
          container for your img.

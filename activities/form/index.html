        <li>
          <h3>The form tag has an "action" attribute. What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            The action attribute is to know where do you want to send the value
            in the form, so if just put the path in the action attribute and
            then when the user submit it, it will send to that path. Almost same
            like the anchor link works.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The form tag has a "method" attribute. What does it do?</h3>
          <p>
            The method is like how the way we want the value to be send, there
            are two ways which are post and get. So, when we have method
            attribute it means we choose which way or which method we want the
            value to be send.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What is the difference between a "POST" and a "GET"?</h3>
          <p>
            The difference between post and get is only in the way how the
            website url will show, if we use post the value from the form
            website will show in the url later, <br />
            In other hand if we use get it will not show up in the url. <br />
            We use post mostly when we search something, and we use get when we
            try to input some password like that.

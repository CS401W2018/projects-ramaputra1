          <h3>1. The title and topic of your site.</h3>
          <p>
            Title: Superstition - Indonesia Version. <br />
            Topic: Superstition, culture about beliefs in Indonesia.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h3>2. A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h3>
          <p>
            I chose this topic to share some traditional beliefs from our
            ancestors in Indonesia (Superstition), some of these beliefs are
            related with some things like luck and things that are irrational to
            humans, but actually apart from that there are reasonable and some
            valuable things why our ancestors have all these beliefs, and on
            this website I will share them. <br /><br />Also! This is the
            Indonesian version, later in the website I will ask in the FORM and
            ask people who have visited my page to share superstitions from
            their culture or country, after that I will create another page or
            add some additional pages for another versions from their country.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h3>
            3. List out the content you will have on the home page and on each
            of the 5 pages (one will have a table on it).
          </h3>
          <p>
            (1)Home Page: <br />
            Title, Nav: (Hero Page/Home, About, Contact, Content) Footer.
            <br /><br />

            Portofolio, Resume, etc. <br /><br />

            (4)Form. <br />
            This one gonna be a form for people that want to share their
            superstition that they have from their country. <br /><br />

            (5)Content 0.Table <br />
            It will show the data about: <br />
            Name Island, Around how many superstitions they have, Common
            superstitions. (The data superstition in Indonesia) <br />

            But this data is not yet valid, it’s more like “about” or based on
            general knowledge. <br /><br />

            (6) (7) (8) (so, on..) for Content *(after the table) <br />
            Gonna be about each Superstition. <br />

            How it looks like gonna be the same like this: <br />

            I will give a (1)title and (2)description then give (3)the reason
            why this is prohibited based on belief, (4) and a reasonable reason
            why this is actually prohibited. Then give the (5)Resources,
            resources could get from someone, it need provide their name; age;
            and where they from or it could be from another website or article
            too.
            <br /><br />

            Example: <br />
            (1)First Superstition: We are not allowed to whistle at night.
            <br />
            (2)There is a superstition in Indonesia that you are not allowed to
            whistle at night. It has become a common belief in many cultures,
            including in Indonesia, that whistling at night can bring bad luck.
            This is one of the myths that has been passed down... <br />
            (3)Reason for the myth: <br />
            Will invite ghosts… <br />
            (4)Logistical reasons: <br />
            It's already night so I'm afraid it will disturb people sleeping…
            <br />
            (5) Resources: <br />
            -Rama <br />
            -22 Years Old <br />
            -Central Java, Indonesia.

            4. What fields (or information you will collect) you will put into
            your form? What data will go on your table?

          <h3>
            5. How you will collect information/images/content to put on your
            site. You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least
            2 of references you plan on using. <br />
          </h3>
          <p>
            I will never use the copy right pictures. I will find the Non-copy
            right website only to support my website. For picture I definitely
            will use the Free and No Copyright picture from some websites like:
            <br />
            a. <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a> <br />
            b. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">pexels.com/</a> <br />
            c. <a href="https://www.freepik.com/">freepik.com/</a> <br /><br />

            For information and Content I consider for two resources, first
            someone in real life or from another websites. I prefer the first
            one to collect data from people. Because later I want to create
            another country version for the superstition. So my information and
            content: <br />
            a. I will ask somebody to get the information about some
            superstition they have in their culture. <br />
            <span style="font-style: italic">or I will references to: </span

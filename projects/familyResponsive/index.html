                  My older brother is six years older than me, and he’s already
                  married with one daughter. He’s a kind person, and what makes
                  him truly admirable is how he has dedicated almost half of his
                  life to serving in the church, always putting others before
                  himself. His strong commitment to his service makes him a role
                  model that I respect. Even though he can be a bit strict with
                  me at times.

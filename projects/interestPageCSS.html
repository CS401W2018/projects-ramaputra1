      <h2 class="emp">What is Slank?</h2>
      <p>
        Slank is a very famous rock band from Indonesia, formed in 1983 in
        Jakarta. Their music mixes rock, blues, and traditional Indonesian
        sounds. Many of their songs talk about social and political issues,
        which helped them gain a lot of fans. Slank is also known for their
        strong anti-drug message after some members recovered from addiction.
        They are very influential in Indonesia's culture and music.

      <h2 class="emp">Why Slank?</h2>
      <p>
        I love Slank because they express the truth about important issues like
        corruption, injustice, and social inequality in Indonesia. Their song
        emphasized in challenging the government. The way they use their music
        to inspire change and encourage people to stand up for what's right.
        Slankâ€™s message of hope and rebellion connects deeply with my own views
        on wanting a better future.
